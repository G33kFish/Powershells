Here is a shell script to get everyone started with the cleanup.
Create a file on your server;
nano 3cx-desktopapp-cleanup.sh
-------------------------------------
# Disable 3CX Unattended-Upgrades Service
systemctl stop unattended-upgrades
# Collect the version of 3CX Desktop Apps on the Server
cd /var/lib/3cxpbx/Instance1/Data/Http/electron
ls -la * > /root/3cx-desktop-versions.log
# Remove the files
rm -rf /var/lib/3cxpbx/Instance1/Data/Http/electron/osx/*.dmg
rm -rf /var/lib/3cxpbx/Instance1/Data/Http/electron/osx/*.zip
rm -rf /var/lib/3cxpbx/Instance1/Data/Http/electron/windows/*.msi
rm -rf /var/lib/3cxpbx/Instance1/Data/Http/electron/windows/*.nupkg
--------------------------------------
run the file
sh 3cx-desktopapp-cleanup.sh
You can check the status of the service
systemctl status unattended-upgrades
You should see it shutdown
root@3cx:# systemctl status unattended-upgrades
unattended-upgrades.service - Unattended Upgrades Shutdown
